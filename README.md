# Speaker
A small app that uses the speechSynthesis API to read content aloud

**3rd Party Libraries**: [Simple HTML Dom](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/)

**Demo**: http://csskarma.com/speaker/

## Dependencies
PHP if you want to use the URL reader, otherwise you don't need anything (I guess you need JavaScript)

## Support
The Speech Synthesis API works in Chrome and IE 14 ( [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-synthesis) ), so that's where this app will work.
